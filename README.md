Features of the app are:
* Input via voice (Android, iOS and Chrome Browser) and text
* Text-to-Speech voice output
* WebSocket based chat with SEPIA and other users that are registered on your private or public server ([see Chat-Server](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-websocket-server-java))
* Customizable start-screen with user-recommendations (created by the SEPIA server)
* In-chat card results (e.g. for to-do lists), audio player (e.g. for web-radio) and in-app browser for iOS and Android
* User-account management
* Teach-interface to add your own commands/chats/actions to SEPIA ([see Teach-Server](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-teach-server))
* Customizable look (skins for the app)
* Tutorial and help screens to get started
* Remote-actions to communicate between clients and devices (e.g. for [wake-word](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-wakeword-tools) integration)
* Deeplinks to open the app via URLs
* Local notifications (e.g. for alarms - push-notifications under construction)
* Language support for german and english
* Completely open-source

### Quick-start

The latest release version is always online at: https://sepia-framework.github.io/app/index.html  
If you don't operate a SEPIA server you can still look around a bit in "demo-mode" when skipping the log-in though most of the features will not be active in this mode.  
Android and iOS apps are in beta-test phase and will be release "when they are done" :-p  
  
For experts only: Use the install-scripts in the repository to build your own version of the app.
