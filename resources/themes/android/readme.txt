Uses theme and background image for fast launch screen (that does not stay longer as needed):
put:
background_splash.xml 	-> res/drawable
launch_screen.png 	-> res/drawable
styles.xml 		-> res/values

Note: currently only the styles file is actually in use because the splashscreen plugin creates a smoother transition
